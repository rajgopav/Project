All folder names are named after the algorithms that we have worked on.
All the folders conatins .exe files for executing them.

If the .exe files does not work, we need to import the .cpp files to any development environments like visual studio or Dev C++.

Instructions for uploading in visual studio:
1) We need to create a new console project.
2) Add these files to the project.
3) Execute the local debugger and generate the output.

Instructions for uploading in Dev C++:
1) We can directly import the required files into the environment.

Note:
For the DFS_VS2010, 
1) Import the solution file into the visual studio 2010 development environment.
2) Execute the local debugger option to see the ouput of the ring structure.
